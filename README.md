## Database with Neon

This boilerplate uses [Neon](https://neon.com/) as the primary database solution, providing a modern serverless PostgreSQL experience that's perfect for full-stack applications.

### Why Neon?

**Neon** is a serverless PostgreSQL platform that separates storage and compute, offering several key advantages:

- **Zero-Friction Setup**: Create databases instantly without signup via [neon.new](https://neon.new/) - perfect for prototyping
- **Serverless Architecture**: Automatically scales to zero when not in use, reducing costs
- **Instant Provisioning**: Create database branches in seconds, not minutes
- **Developer-Friendly**: Built-in connection pooling, automatic backups, and point-in-time recovery
- **Database Branching**: Create database branches for each feature, just like Git branches
- **Modern Tooling**: Native integration with popular ORMs like Drizzle, Prisma, and more
- **Global Edge**: Low-latency read replicas across multiple regions

### Quick Setup

Get started with Neon in minutes using one of these approaches:

#### Option 1: Instant Database Creation (No Login Required)

Choose any of these three methods for instant database setup:

**Method A: Browser Setup**
1. Visit [neon.new](https://neon.new/) to instantly create a new PostgreSQL database

**Method B: CLI Script**
2. Use our built-in script for instant setup:
   ```bash
   bun run db:neon-setup
   # This runs: npx neondb --yes
   ```

**Method C: Automatic Vite Plugin (Recommended)**
3. **Already configured!** The [`@neondatabase/vite-plugin-postgres`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neondatabase/vite-plugin-postgres) plugin automatically:
   - Checks for `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file on first `bun run dev`
   - Creates a claimable Neon database if not found
   - Writes the connection string directly to your `.env` file
   - Provides both direct and pooled connection strings
   - Gives you a 7-day claim URL to take ownership
   
   **Just run `bun run dev` and you're ready to go!** ✨

All methods create a temporary Neon database **instantly without requiring any login or signup**. Perfect for:
- Quick prototyping and testing
- Open-source templates and demos
- Getting started immediately without account setup
- Temporary development environments

**Note**: The database expires after 72 hours unless you claim it with a free Neon account.

#### Option 2: Permanent Database Setup
1. **Sign up**: Create a free account at [neon.com](https://neon.com/)
2. **Create project**: Set up a permanent database in your dashboard
3. **Get connection string**: Copy from your Neon project dashboard

#### Final Step: Configure Connection
Copy your Neon connection string to your `.env` file:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[user]:[password]@[endpoint]/[database]?sslmode=require
```

## MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

This boilerplate includes a fully functional **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server that allows AI assistants like Claude Desktop and Cursor to interact with your application's tools and data in real-time.

### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is a standard for connecting AI assistants to external tools and data sources. It enables your AI assistant to execute functions, access APIs, and interact with your application directly from the chat interface.

### Implementation

The MCP server is implemented using the [`@vercel/mcp-adapter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/mcp-adapter) package, adapted for **TanStack Start** (instead of Next.js). The implementation consists of:

- **MCP Handler**: Located at `src/routes/api/ai/mcp/$transport.ts`
- **Tools Definition**: Located at `src/lib/ai/mcp-tools.ts`

### Available Tools

The boilerplate comes with several example tools that demonstrate different capabilities:

- **`getCatFact`**: Fetches random cat facts from an external API
- **`getQuote`**: Retrieves inspirational quotes from an external API  
- **`getJoke`**: Gets random programming jokes from an external API
- **`getWelcomeMessage`**: Simple greeting with parameter input
- **`calculateBMI`**: BMI calculator with weight and height parameters
- **`getTodos`**: Retrieves todos from the application's database (demonstrates database integration)

### Configuration for AI Assistants

#### Claude Desktop

Add the following configuration to your Claude Desktop config file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-app": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "http://localhost:3000/api/ai/mcp/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor

Add the following configuration to your Cursor MCP config file at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-app": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "http://localhost:3000/api/ai/mcp/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding New Tools

To add new tools to your MCP server:

1. **Define the tool function** in `src/lib/ai/mcp-tools.ts`:

```typescript
const yourNewTool = async ({ param }: { param: string }) => {
  // Your tool logic here
  return {
    content: [{ type: "text", text: `Result: ${param}` }],
  };
};
```

2. **Add the tool to the tools array**:

```typescript
export const tools = [
  // ... existing tools
  {
    name: "yourNewTool",
    description: "Description of what your tool does",
    callback: yourNewTool,
    inputSchema: z.object({
      param: z.string(),
    }),
  },
];
```

3. **Restart your development server** and the AI assistant to pick up the new tool.

### Usage

Once configured, you can interact with your tools directly from your AI assistant:

- Ask Claude or Cursor to "get a cat fact" → triggers `getCatFact`
- Say "calculate my BMI for 70kg and 1.75m" → triggers `calculateBMI`
- Request "tell me a joke" → triggers `getJoke`
- Ask "show me my todos" or "what needs to be done" → triggers `getTodos`
- Say "welcome me as John" → triggers `getWelcomeMessage`

The AI assistant will automatically determine which tools to use based on your requests and execute them in real-time, including accessing your application's database for dynamic data.

    ```
    
    Key environment variables to configure:
    
    - **Database:** Neon Postgres database (automatically configured!)
      - **Zero-config setup**: Just run `bun run dev` - the Vite plugin will automatically create a database and configure your `.env` file
      - **Alternative methods**: Visit [neon.new](https://neon.new/) or run `bun run db:neon-setup` for manual setup
      - **No signup needed**: All methods create temporary databases without any registration
      - **72-hour trial**: Database expires after 72 hours unless claimed with a free Neon account
      - **Auto-configured**: The plugin writes the connection string to your `.env` file automatically
    
    - **Auth:** Generate a secure secret for Better Auth
      ```bash
      # Generate a secure random string
      openssl rand -base64 32
      ```
      Add it to your `.env` file as `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
    
    - **Email:** Set up a [Resend](https://resend.com/) account for email sending
      - Get your API key and add it as `RESEND_API_KEY`
    
    - **Monitoring (optional):** Configure Sentry for error tracking
      - Get your DSN, organization, and project values from your Sentry dashboard
      - Set the corresponding environment variables

5.  **Database Setup:**
    Ensure your PostgreSQL database is running and accessible.
    Push the schema (for development/initial setup):
    ```bash
    bun run db:push
    ```
    *For production or more controlled migrations, generate migration files:* 
    ```bash
    # bun run db:generate
    # Apply migrations (tool/command depends on setup)
    ```
    *Optional: Use `bun run db:studio` to explore the schema via Drizzle Studio.*

6.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
